# Test

This one is a Test Repo which gives a basic infra for any project

Step 1: npm init [it will create a package.json for you]
Step 2: npm i webpack -S [it will install webpack for you]
Step 3: touch webpack.config.js [it will create a webpack.config.js file for you]
Step 4: add webpack basic config content
Step 5: create "index.jsx" file with some basic javascript console.log [if that is working basic setup is done]
Step 6: ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d [executing this command will build a bundle for you]
Step 7: create "index.html" which should take bundle.jsx
Step 8: npm i babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react -S [executing this command on terminal will do a setup for babel installation since browser does not understand jsx code -- it always need a js file to understand]
Step 9: create .babelrc file
Step 10: keep its basic content in it
Step 11: Now add loaders in webpack file
Step 12: npm i react react-dom -S [executing this command will install react for you]
Step 13: now you can modify index.jsx with some react component code
Step 14: opening that HTML file should work for you after building bundle
Step 15: you can add "dev" and "build" scripts as well in package.json
